The recipe involves making a masala paste by blending garlic, cashew nuts, green chilies, cloves, and low-fat milk. This paste is then set aside. Next, a pan is heated with healthier oil to fry cumin seeds, onion, and ginger along with turmeric, coriander, and curry powder until fragrant. Vegetables and water are added to the pan, allowed to simmer and come to a boil. The masala paste is then incorporated, and the mixture is simmered to reduce the gravy. The dish is seasoned with lower sodium salt to taste. The recipe encourages using herbs and spices instead of salt for added flavor depth.
